## Your Tasks

Write a program in the file **navigate.py** that allows the user to navigate the lines of text in a file. The program should prompt the user for a filename and input the lines of text into a list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line numbers range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the program prints the line associated with that number. (LO: 5.1)

You can use either the **navigate.py** file or create a new file in this environment to test your program's functionality.

> Note: The tests for this exercise use external text files. As a result, the test feedback might reference text that is referenced in this lab. Double check when running your program that it displays the correct line when prompted.
